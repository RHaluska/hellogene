A short test for github and Python to get back in the swing of things

Given a source file, fetches data about a string as it relates to the file. Simply, checks for existance in the file, spits out location(s). Maybe support for insertions/deletions/substitutions. Plenty of possibilities to add.

Notes for myself:
Test cases: line breaks/input noise? Mismatch allowance equaling or exceeding input length? Configuration? 

Possibilities: Some sort of matchy equation (alternative to specifying number of mistakes, specify threshold and have different mistakes "worth more"). Something more elegant than initial brute-force. Different filetypes? Scrubbing files of identifiers, spaces, line breaks?
